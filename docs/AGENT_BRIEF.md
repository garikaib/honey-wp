# Agent Briefing: Honeyscroop WordPress Project

This document serves as a "quick start" and context download for any AI agent working on this codebase.

## 1. Technology Stack
*   **Environment**: DDEV (Docker-based PHP environment). PHP 8.3, MariaDB 10.11, NGINX.
*   **Backend**: 100% Native WordPress (No ACF). Custom Post Types registered via PHP in `inc/`.
*   **Frontend Styling**: Tailwind CSS (bundled via Vite). **DaisyUI** is the primary component library.
*   **Frontend Logic**: React 18.
    *   **Architecture**: "Islands Architecture". React apps live in `src/[feature]/`, compile to `dist/[feature].js`, and mount to specific DOM IDs in PHP files.
*   **Build Tool**: Vite (handles React & Tailwind compilation).

## 2. Key Directories & structure
Root: `wp-content/themes/honeyscroop-theme/`

*   `src/`: **SOURCE OF TRUTH** for all JS/React and CSS.
    *   `src/style.css`: Main Tailwind entry point.
    *   `src/[feature]/index.jsx`: React entry points (e.g., `product-grid`, `partner-ticker`, `honey-finder`).
*   `dist/`: **DO NOT EDIT**. Compiled assets generated by Vite.
*   `inc/`: PHP functionality.
    *   `assets.php`: Enqueues scripts from `dist/` and passes data via `wp_localize_script`.
    *   `cpt-*.php`: Register Custom Post Types (Honey Variety, Partners).
*   `patterns/`: PHP Block Patterns. These serve as the "Views" that contain the React mount points (e.g., `<div id="partner-ticker-root"></div>`).
*   `functions.php`: Main theme setup, includes files from `inc/`.

## 3. Development Workflow
1.  **Frontend Changes**:
    *   Edit files in `src/`.
    *   Run `npm run build` to update `dist/` files.
    *   **Note**: We strictly use `vite build` for production-ready assets (no HMR server active in WP currently, simpler to just build).
2.  **Backend Changes**:
    *   Edit PHP files in `inc/` or theme root.
    *   Restart required only if adding new DDEV configs (rare).
3.  **Deployment**:
    *   Code is pushed to GitHub `main` branch.

## 4. Current React Components
*   **Product Grid** (`src/product-grid`):
    *   Displays product categories.
    *   Uses **3D Hover Effect** (custom `useRef` physics) and "White Glass" styling.
    *   Mounts in `patterns/product-categories.php`.
*   **Partner Ticker** (`src/partner-ticker`):
    *   Infinite scrolling marquee of logos.
    *   Fetches from `partner` CPT via REST API (`/wp-json/wp/v2/partner`).
    *   Mounts in `patterns/partner-belt.php`.
*   **Honey Finder** (`src/honey-finder`):
    *   Interactive filter for honey products.

## 5. Important Rules
*   **Styling**: Use Tailwind utility classes. Use DaisyUI components (`card`, `btn`, etc.) wherever possible.
*   **Icons**: Use `lucide-react`.
*   **State**: Use standard React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`).
*   **REST API**: Expose CPTs to REST (`show_in_rest => true`) to consume them in React.
